# Galaxy Brain
Is working from home getting you down? Are the days blurring into each other, maybe you're working long hours without remembering to take a break?

We believe that your best work is done when you're feeling healthy and relaxed. We built Galaxy Brain as a simple way to make time for yourself. A friendly, easy-to-use timer can be left on in the background as you work, and gently reminds you when it's time to stop and rest for a while. Then, when break time is over, it lets you know when to get back to it.

Our prototype includes a pause/resume button to stop the timer if need be, a time selector for picking how long you'd like your focus and rest periods to last, and ping sounds that play to alert you when the time is up.

We learned a lot building this project, and are excited to bring it to you! Stay safe out there :heart:
